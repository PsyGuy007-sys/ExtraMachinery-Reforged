## Botanical Machinery Extra Reforged

</div>



This mod is an addon for the **[Botanical Machinery](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/BotanicalMachinery?tab=readme-ov-file)** 
mod and is developed using their technologies. Some files have been adjusted to eliminate errors and vulnerabilities in multiplayer, but the main code still remains with the developers of **[Botanical Machinery](https://github.com/ChaoticTrials/BotanicalMachinery?tab=readme-ov-file)** .


#### The only thing that is strictly prohibited and subject to copyright is the textures of the graphical interfaces for each mechanism. The rest can be used in the public domain.
